Using one language as a pivot language between translation of 2 other languages. Example; lots of Engish-Arabic/English-Greek translation data, not much Arabic-Greek translation data. Use English as a pivot language for translation of Arabic to Greek and vice versa.

Interesting use of MTin dissaster response situations where translaters may not be readily available.
